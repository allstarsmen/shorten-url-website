### Gathering requirements:
- Talk to the customer to know more about what they need
  - ex: custome want a shorten URL website
    - Discuss with him about, what type of URLS should the app supports, how long the shortened URL will be kept on the server, should we limit the number of creation of URLs for each user, etc...

### Analysis
- Dive deeper into the requirements and make a list of require features. Try to figure out if there is any hidden features we need to implements (Ex: Auto delete unused URLs, etc...)
- Decide with technology should be used in the project.
- Making a list of tasks based on the information of the 2 steps above (ex: Task - create an development environment by using Docker, Task - create a blueprint for backend, etc...).
